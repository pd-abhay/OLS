OLS

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a fundamental method in statistics and machine learning for estimating the parameters of a linear regression model. It is widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency in modeling relationships between variables. 

OLS aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals between observed and predicted values.

ols = ((x' @ x)^-1) @ (x' @ y)
